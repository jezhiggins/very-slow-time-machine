We live in interesting times. Truth, objectivity, facts, actual hard proved by science irrefutable facts, seem to be up for grabs. Any statement, at any time, can, it seems, be dismissed as 'incomplete', 'misleading', 'based on alternative facts', or, increasing dismissed as straight-up lies, as "fake news".

Any one know the origin of "May you live in interesting times?".

Chinese Curse? Fakes news!

First reported use appears to be by Austen Chamberlain, son of Joseph, brother of Neville, some time in 1936. His father said used the same phrasing, but with a different intent, in 1898 and 1901.

How do we know this? Through the use of documentary archives - in this case the archives of "The Yorkshire Post" and "The Western Daily Press".

When we talk about the archives of The Yorkshire Post and of The Western Daily Press we're talking, of course, about boxes and boxes of newspapers. Actual physical objects, that we can hold in our hands, and look at. We can have a high degree of trust in those newspapers, because we can examine them, see that they are what they purport to be - newspapers from the 1930s - and so they provide a reliable, trustworthy, window into the past.

It's not just newspapers, of course - church registers, company records, estate ledgers, and so on - all provide similar windows.

The physical records from the past are extremely difficult to tamper with, and almost impossible to forge.

Paper (or vellum or papyrus or whatever) isn't ideal though.
