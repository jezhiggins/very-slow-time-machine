* Facts are not true just because theyâ€™re facts

[NOTE.speaker]

We live in interesting times. Truth, objectivity, facts, actual hard proved by science irrefutable facts, seem to be up for grabs. Any statement, at any time, can, it seems, be dismissed as 'incomplete', 'misleading', 'based on alternative facts', or, increasing dismissed as straight-up lies, as "fake news".

Any one know the origin of "May you live in interesting times?".

Chinese Curse? Fake news!

First reported use appears to be by Austen Chamberlain, son of Joseph, brother of Neville, some time in 1936. His father said used the same phrasing, but with a different intent, in 1898 and 1901.

How do we know this? Through the use of documentary archives - in this case the archives of "The Yorkshire Post" and "The Western Daily Press".

When we talk about the archives of The Yorkshire Post and of The Western Daily Press we're talking, of course, about boxes and boxes of newspapers. Actual physical objects, that we can hold in our hands, and look at. We can have a high degree of trust in those newspapers, because we can examine them, see that they are what they purport to be - newspapers from the 1930s - and so they provide a reliable, trustworthy, window into the past.

It's not just newspapers, of course - church registers, company records, estate ledgers, and so on - all provide similar windows.

The physical records from the past are extremely difficult to tamper with, and almost impossible to forge.

Paper (or vellum or papyrus or whatever) isn't ideal though.

Paper isn't really durable. A lot of it is pretty low quality, and ages badly - it just kind of breaks down.

It's also quite flammable.

Norwich, of course, is a famously old city, although perhaps not now quite as important as it once was. Consequently it had a very rich history, and the library's archive included items dating as far back as 1090.

Unfortunately a big chunk of that archive was lost in 1994, when the library caught fire following a gas explosion. There were something like 100,000 books destroyed in the fire. It wasn't actually the fire that damaged much of the archival record though. A lot of that was stored in lovely fireproof vaults in the basement. Unfortunately, those were flooded in the attempt to extinguish the flames.

At the time the library had recently been refurbished, but a sprinkler system was not fitted because it was considered it would do unacceptable damage in the event of a small fire.

The damage in the case of a large fire hadn't, apparently, been considered but turned out to be considerable.

So those records were lost - including (I think) the city's Charter from Richard I, but also more recent records such as American Air Division Memorial Library, which was a record of what American airman did in Norfolk during the war - seduce the local ladies and then bugger off home probably, but we'll never really know. The library is gone from history, and this city, and by extension this country and beyond, has a hole in its history.

So what's the solution to the flammable, fragile document problem?

Digital right?

We can just scan all those paper document into lovely, easy to store digital copies. We can, I don't know, back them up into the cloud.  Then we can laugh in the face of fire and flood.

Plus, of course, more and more new documents that we want to keep are "digital native". They were created on a computer, of some kind, and never exist as an actual physical artifact at all.

So digital, right?

Well, yes, but also no.

Digital documents, and by documents here I mean text, pictures - whether artwork or photographs, videos, sound recordings, etc, etc, may indeed be easier to store safely.  Well, up to a point. The physical media is still subject to degradation, but lets assume we can solve that problem.

The issue with digital documents is one of authenticity. They are supremely easy to tamper with, whether accidentally or on purposes, with malicious or benign intent.  They are also frightfully easy to forge.

Sean Spicer, the Whitehouse press secretary, said Donald Trump drew "the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe".

So, here's a photo of the Trump inauguration and on the right is a photo from more or less the same point at the end of the National Mall of the crowd at the Obama inauguration.

What do we believe about theses photos? Why?

What is about these photos that means we think they are true representations, that they haven't been edited, that they where taken at the same kind of time? Why do we think Spicer and Trump are barefaced liars?

So the source is important? Reuters have a reputation as a reliable news agency, providing rapid, accurate reporting right? You don't need to know the history of the news agency, which dates back to 1850, and includes, for example, resisting British government pressure to 'better serve the national interest' during WW2, to know their reputation.

Trump, on the hand, well pretty much the only thing he says which is true is his name.

It's not just the document that's important then, it's the provenance. It's where it comes from, who's vouching for it.

Now the example I've just given is easily resolved. We have the contemporaneous photo, and we can debunk it in more or less in real time.

But what about documents which aren't from right now? I have a neighbour who's mother's estate is stuck in probate because they're having difficulty in establishing the borders of the farm. They're basically having to interview old blokes saying "yes, that there field belonged to her". Would digital records help here?

And what about records that released after a certain amount of time? A lot of government records are, for example, sealed (closed in archive speak) for a period of time - 20 years typically, but sometimes longer.

If you recall my opening slide, those vouchsafed with authority are being undermined. In fifty years time, 20 years, maybe only 5 years, will enough of us still regard Reuters as reliable? I think this kind of trust is a bit like herd immunity - in the UK enough of think Trump is a fool that we're not taken in, but in the US almost enough believe him that the institutions of society are starting to crumble.

If institutional trust is undermined, what credence can we give a bunch of PDFs labelled "what Tony Blair did in the Iraq War"? (Possibly a bad example - those are probably paper, but you get the idea.) PDFs? Anyone could have monkeyed with those. Or left some out, or put something extra in. Or anything. It's just a bunch of bits, and who the hell are you anyway?

ARCHANGEL is a aiming to avert that future. That's the aim of ARCHANGEL. We're trying to save society from slipping away and dissolving into nothing.
