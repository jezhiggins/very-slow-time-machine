Project is still has another six or eight months to run, so who knows quite where it might end up.

Ideally, at some point in the not to different future, we'll have a consortium of institutions around the world cooperating to produce this publically readable, publically verifiable ledger describing all the documents coming in their archives.

A shift from a solely institutional underscoring of trust to one supported by technology

It will allow archives to defend their records, allowing us, wider society, to have confidence in the documents the preserve for and provide to us.  It will, additionally, allow archives to be transparent in the practice - look here's the stuff we're dealing with, here's the software we're using, you can check it.

And maybe, maybe, that'll make the world a little bit better.

Snakes Into Snake Oil +
What Blockchains Are And Why They’re Terrible

ACCU Conference

The talk I've just given is the 45 minute version of the last 2 minutes of a 90 minute session I'm doing at the ACCU Conference entitled

Snakes Into Snake Oil +
What Blockchains Are And Why They’re Terrible

So looking at the technical details of distributed ledger technologies, consensus mechanisms, why you need 12 GPUs daisy chained together to mine new blocks, why writing smart contracts is really hard, and shouldn't you just be using a database anyway?

Obviously, I'm only a support acts at the ACCU Conference - in the acoustic tent next to the portaloos, not the pyramid stage or anything like that - but do come along if you fancy it.
